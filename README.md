# Joystick DB9 to USB adapter
Connect an Atari/Amiga joystick or mouse to your PC using USB.

While plugging or powering up the adapter :
- leave all buttons disconnected to use a standard 1-3 buttons joystick or a CD32 pad (not really tested)
- press button 1 to control the PC mouse pointer using the joystick
- press button 2/right mouse button to use an Amiga mouse to control the PC pointer
- press both button 1 and 2/left and right mouse buttons to use an Atari mouse to control the PC pointer
